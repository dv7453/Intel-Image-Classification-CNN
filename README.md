Project Overview
The Intel Image Classification project involves developing a machine learning model capable of classifying images into one of six categories. The dataset used in this project is the Intel Image Classification Dataset, which contains images of various landscapes, including buildings, forests, glaciers, mountains, seas, and streets. The objective is to build a model that can accurately categorize any given image into one of these classes.

Dataset Description
Classes: The dataset consists of six classes:

Buildings
Forest
Glacier
Mountain
Sea
Street
Data Distribution: The dataset is usually divided into training, validation, and test sets. Each set contains images belonging to the six categories, with the training set being the largest.

Image Properties: The images vary in size and quality but are usually resized to a consistent shape (e.g., 150x150 pixels) before being fed into the model.

Model Architecture
To perform image classification, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is commonly used due to its effectiveness in processing visual data. Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of the model architecture:

Input Layer: Accepts the image data, typically resized to a consistent dimension (e.g., 150x150x3 for RGB images).

Convolutional Layers: These layers apply filters to the input image to detect various features such as edges, textures, and patterns. Each convolutional layer is followed by:

Activation Function (ReLU): Introduces non-linearity into the model.
Pooling Layers (Max Pooling): Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, which helps in reducing the computational complexity.
Flattening Layer: Converts the 2D matrix data into a 1D vector that can be fed into the fully connected layers.

Fully Connected Layers: These layers are responsible for combining the features detected by the convolutional layers to predict the final class of the image.

Output Layer: Uses a softmax activation function to produce probability scores for each class. The class with the highest probability is chosen as the predicted label.

Training Process
Data Augmentation: To enhance the robustness of the model, data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, zooming, and shifting are applied to the training images. This helps the model generalize better to unseen data.

Loss Function: The categorical cross-entropy loss function is typically used for multi-class classification tasks.

Optimizer: An optimizer like Adam or SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) is used to minimize the loss function during training.

Training and Validation: The model is trained on the training dataset and validated on the validation set to monitor its performance. The training process involves multiple epochs, where the model's weights are updated iteratively to reduce the loss.

Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated on the test set to assess its accuracy and generalization ability.
